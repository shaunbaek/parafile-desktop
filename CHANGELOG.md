# Changelog

All notable changes to ParaFile Desktop will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-04

### Fixed
- **Missing Dependency**: Added `electron-log@^5.4.2` to dependencies to fix auto-updater service initialization error
  - Fixed `Error: Cannot find module 'electron-log'` in `src/services/autoUpdater.js:3`
  - Auto-updater service now initializes properly without module resolution errors
  
- **DMG Build Configuration**: Fixed appdmg build configuration in `forge.config.js`
  - Removed invalid `additionalDMGOptions` property that was causing `Error: data has additional properties`
  - DMG creation now works correctly with `npm run make` command
  - Maintained essential DMG properties: format, overwrite, and name

### Documentation Issues Identified
- **Environment Setup Inconsistency**: CLAUDE.md references `.env.example` file that doesn't exist
  - Only `.env.build.example` exists for build/signing environment variables
  - Need to create `.env.example` with `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here` for development
  
- **README vs CLAUDE.md Conflict**: Contradictory environment setup instructions
  - README states "No .env file needed!" (GUI-first approach)
  - CLAUDE.md provides manual `.env` setup instructions (developer approach)
  - Need to reconcile these two approaches for clarity
  
- **AI Model Version Mismatch**: Documentation vs implementation discrepancy
  - Documentation claims "GPT-4 Turbo" in general terms
  - Code specifically uses `gpt-4-turbo-preview` model in all API calls
  - Should specify exact model version in documentation

### Deployment Testing
- âœ… Successfully packaged application for macOS (arm64)
- âœ… Created DMG installer (128MB) at `out/make/ParaFile Desktop.dmg`
- âœ… Verified packaged app launches independently without development dependencies
- âœ… Confirmed distribution files are properly generated (DMG, ZIP)
- âœ… All build commands working: `package`, `make`, `publish`

### Technical Details
#### Files Modified
- **package.json**: Added `electron-log@^5.4.2` dependency
- **forge.config.js**: Removed `additionalDMGOptions` from DMG maker configuration

#### Build Commands Verified
- `npm start` - Launch GUI application âœ…
- `npm run monitor` - Run headless monitoring service âœ…  
- `npm run package` - Package application âœ…
- `npm run make` - Create distribution files (DMG, ZIP) âœ…
- `npm run publish` - Publish to GitHub releases (configured) âœ…

#### Architecture Verification
- All documented file paths and module locations are accurate
- Core dependencies match documentation specifications
- Configuration structure matches documented JSON format
- Service layer architecture aligns with documentation
