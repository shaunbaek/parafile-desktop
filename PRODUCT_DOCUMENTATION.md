   - Define a naming pattern using variables (e.g., `{date}_{vendor}_{amount}`)

3. **Example Categories**
   ```
   Name: Contracts
   Description: Legal agreements, contracts, and terms of service
   Pattern: {contract_type}_{party_name}_{date}
   
   Name: Reports
   Description: Business reports, analytics, and performance summaries
   Pattern: {report_type}_{period}_{department}
   ```

### Creating Custom Variables

Variables extract specific information from documents:

2. **Add a Variable**
   - Click "Add Variable"
   - Enter a name (e.g., "invoice_date")

   - Or use "AI Suggest" to generate variables from natural language

3. **Example Variables**
   ```
   Name: vendor_name
   Description: Extract the vendor or company name from invoices
   
   Name: contract_value
   Description: Extract the total contract value or amount

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API Key Invalid"**
- Verify your API key at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
- Ensure your account has GPT-4 access
- Check for any leading/trailing spaces in the key

**"No Documents Being Processed"**
- Verify monitoring is started (green status indicator)
- Check that new files are PDF or Word documents
- Ensure files are being added to the monitored folder
- Look for errors in the Processing Log

**"Application Won't Start"**
- Run `npm ci` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check Node.js version is 16 or higher: `node --version`
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm ci` again

### File Processing

**Supported Formats**
- PDF files (`.pdf`)
- Word documents (`.doc`, `.docx`)

**Processing Requirements**
- Files must contain extractable text
- Scanned PDFs without OCR won't be processed
- Password-protected files are skipped

### Performance Tips

- **Large Folders**: Initial scan may take time for folders with many files
- **Processing Queue**: Documents are processed one at a time to ensure accuracy
- **API Limits**: Be aware of your OpenAI API rate limits
- **Resource Usage**: Close other applications if experiencing slowdowns

## üìä Advanced Usage

### Naming Pattern Examples

Create sophisticated naming patterns using variables:

```
Invoice Pattern: {year}-{month}_{vendor}_{invoice_number}
Result: 2024-03_Acme Corp_INV-12345.pdf

Contract Pattern: {contract_type}_{client_name}_{effective_date}
Result: Service Agreement_Tech Solutions_2024-03-15.pdf

Report Pattern: {report_type}_{quarter}_{year}_{department}
Result: Financial Report_Q1_2024_Sales.pdf
```

### Category Best Practices

Write clear descriptions for better AI categorization:

**Good Description**:
"Financial invoices, bills, payment requests, and receipts from vendors or suppliers"

**Poor Description**:
"Money stuff"

### Variable Extraction Tips

Be specific about format and context:

**Good Variable**:
```
Name: invoice_total
Description: Extract the total amount from invoices, including currency symbol (e.g., $1,234.56)
```

**Poor Variable**:
```
Name: amount
Description: Get the number
```
